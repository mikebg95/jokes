This app was made as part of the beginners Scrimba React course. The app is an app that imports jokes (and punchlines) from a data file, and passes that data to custom reusable Joke components, which are then rendered on the screen.

The goals of the app were to:

(1) get familiar with basic React concepts like passing and destructuring props, and using reusable components
